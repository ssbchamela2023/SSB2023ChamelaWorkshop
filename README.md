Dear attendee to Chamela Station Workshop

The organizing committee wish you a very happy 2023 for you and all your love ones! 

We are looking forward to meet you, and very enthusiast for our upcoming workshop. In preparation for the event, we are including a list of the software (and R packages) that will be needed along our activities.

Is strongly recommended to install the software in advance. Some technical assistance may be available the days before the workshop, only for those requesting it in advance.

Please feel free to make any question

Software 

1. R with Rstudio. We strongly recommend to use RStudio, rather than R console, in order tho have the same interface for all the attendees and save time. If you are largely proficient with R and the console, please feel free to use wherever works the best for you.
